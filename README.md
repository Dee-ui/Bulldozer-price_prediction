# Bulldozer-price_prediction
This is a project with the goal of developing a machine learning model that is capable of predicting the sale price of a particular piece of heavy equipment based on it's usage, equipment type, and configuaration. 

# Bluebook for Bulldozers

## Project Description
This project's primary goal is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the sale price of a specific piece of heavy equipment at auction. The prediction is based on various factors, including equipment usage, equipment type, and configuration. This project utilizes a dataset sourced from auction result postings, which includes valuable information about usage and equipment configurations.

## About the Data
The dataset used in this project is obtained from the Kaggle competition "Bluebook for Bulldozers". Both the training and test data sets used for model development and evaluation are sourced from this Kaggle competition. The data is structured and includes features that provide insights into the heavy equipment being sold at auction.
